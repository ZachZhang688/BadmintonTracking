# BadmintonTracking
This is a implementation of Algorithm for Badminton Tracking. Given a video to the program. Then the user is required to set box on the badminton in the first frame by mouse. This algorithm can track the badminton and output badminton location in bounding box for the following frames. 



# Using of this program
1 Set video in your own path.
2 run command "python badminton2.py" to get the tracking output.
3 run command "python speed_calculate.py" to get the speed of the badminton in pixels/second.
